# Court-Data-Fetcher
This project is a high-fidelity, production-ready simulation of the Indian Judicial Service Portal (Case Status Lookup). It uses HTML/CSS to build a professional, government-standard UI and JavaScript to simulate secure, API-driven data retrieval and network latency. The focus is on demonstrating realistic system architecture.
